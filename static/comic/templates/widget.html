<div ng-controller="ComicController">  
  <p>{{ module }} Widget</p>
  <p>Imagine a funny pic here</p>
  
  <p>The widget id is bound in the widget-id attribute of the  widget-body directive</p>
  <p>Then in the ComicController it's assigned to the "id" scope attribute: {{ id }}</p>
  <p>This is acquired through the modelFactory. The site name is <b>{{siteName}}</p>
